       <h1>Filipino Dishes: The Original Fusion Food:</h1> 
       <div class
           <strong><h4>While the other pieces in my “Origins of Foods We Love” series feature specific dishes, this one will spotlight an entire country’s food. That’s because the influences on Filipino food as we know it today spans both time and place. The Philippines comprises more than 7,107 islands tucked between the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea; its location placed the Philippines within the path of migration and trade for thousands and thousands of years. And with migrating humans come new ingredients, dishes, and traditions.

Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation.

The Filipino foods we eat today are a direct fusion of indigenous ingredients, flavours, and outside influence. With such a wide geography and rich indigenous history, each area of the Philippines reflects these influences in local variations of popular dishes.  </h4></strong>

      <strong> <h2 style="font-size:30px">The Best Dishes To Eat in The Philippines:</h2> </strong>
           <h3 style="font-size:30px"> Adobo:</h3>
           <strong><p>It’s the Filipino dish everybody knows — the mighty adobo. It is made by stewing meat (usually chicken, pork, or a combination of both) in soy sauce and vinegar, adding peppercorns and bay leaves for that special flavour. Bonus leftovers tip: pull the meat from the bone and fry ’til crispy for some tasty adobo flakes.</p></strong>

       <h3 style="font-size:30px"> Kare-Kare:</h3>
          <strong><p>This rich stew is made with peanut sauce and, customarily, oxtail, but other meatier cuts of beef can also be added in. Many Filipinos will consider kare-kare incomplete without a serving of bagoong (fermented seafood paste) on the side.</p>

       <h3 style="font-size:30px">Letchong Baboy:</h3>
          <strong><p>One of the top contenders among the best Filipino dishes (alongside adobo) is perhaps the famous lechon. After all, it is hard to top a tasty, fully-roasted pig with perfectly crisp skin and juicy meat. Find the best of this sinful treat on the island of Cebu, but this is almost always served at any grand Pinoy gathering or fiesta.</p></strong>

       <h3 style="font-size:30px">Sinigang</h3> 
         <strong><p>
         Sinigang is a Pinoy classic. A delicious sour broth usually made tangy by tamarind (sometimes kamias), it’s filled with different vegetables and a meat of choice. Popular variants include sinigang na baboy (pork), sinigang na hipon (shrimp), and sinigang na isda (fish)</p></strong>
